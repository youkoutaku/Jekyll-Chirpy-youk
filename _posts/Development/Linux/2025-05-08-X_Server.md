When working on remote development via SSH, you sometimes need a graphical user interface (GUI). For example, I use ROS with [VS Code on a Windows machine via SSH to access a Linux host](https://youkoutaku.github.io/posts/UbuntuSSH/). This guide explains how to set up and use an X server on Windows to run graphical Linux applications remotely via SSH.

## 1. Install X Server for Windows

Download and install **VcXsrv**, a popular X Server for Windows, from the following link:

[VcXsrv Windows X Server download | SourceForge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/)

---

## 2. Start and Configure VcXsrv

Ensure that **VcXsrv** is running on your Windows machine and listening for incoming connections. Follow these steps to start and configure it:

1. Open **VcXsrv** (search for `VcXsrv` in your Start Menu).
2. Start a new **X server** session with the following options:
   - **Display number**: `0`
   - **Start no client**: Leave this as it is.
   - Check the box for **Disable access control** (this allows all machines to connect to the X server without requiring special permissions).

> **Note**: Disabling access control can pose security risks. Use this option only in trusted environments.

---

## 3. Connect to the Linux Host via SSH

Use the `ssh` command with the `-X` flag to enable X11 forwarding:

```bash
ssh -X <username>@<host_ip_address>
```

Replace `<username>` with your Linux username and `<host_ip_address>` with the IP address of the Linux machine.

> **Tip**: If your Linux host's IP address changes frequently, consider setting a static IP address or using a hostname with DNS.

---

## 4. Set the `DISPLAY` Environment Variable on Linux

On the Linux host, set the `DISPLAY` environment variable to point to your Windows machine's IP address. Run the following command:

```bash
export DISPLAY=<local_ip_address>:0.0
```

Replace `<local_ip_address>` with the IP address of your Windows machine.

> **Tip**: If your Windows machine's IP address changes frequently, consider assigning it a static IP address.

---

## 5. Allow Connections with `xhost`

Run the following command on the Linux host to allow connections to the X server:

```bash
xhost +
```

> **Note**: Allowing all connections with `xhost +` is not secure. For better security, use `xhost +<specific_ip>` to allow only your Windows machine.

---

## 6. Test Running an X Application

To verify that the setup is working, try running a simple X application like `xclock`:

```bash
xclock
```

If everything is configured correctly, the `xclock` application should appear on your Windows desktop.

---

## 7. Running GUI Applications in Docker Containers

To run GUI applications inside a Docker container and display them on your Windows machine, use the following command when creating the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  --env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  --env QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 \
  --volume /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw \
  your_image \
  bash
```

- `--env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY`: Passes the `DISPLAY` environment variable to the container.
- `--env QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1`: Fixes potential issues with shared memory in Qt applications.
- `--volume /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw`: Mounts the X11 socket for communication between the container and the host.
- `your_image`: Replace this with the name of your Docker image.

By following these steps, you can run graphical Linux applications on your Windows machine using an X Server and SSH.
