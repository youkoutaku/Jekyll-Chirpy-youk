This guide explains how to configure a static IP address on Ubuntu using the `netplan` configuration system. Setting a static IP is useful for servers or devices that need a consistent network address.

---

## 1. Locate the Network Configuration File

```bash
cd /etc/netplan/
ls
```

This will list the available `.yaml` files. Typically, there is only one file, such as `01-netcfg.yaml` or a similarly named file.

---

## 2. Edit the Configuration File

Open the configuration file for editing. Replace `<netcfg>` with the actual filename you found in the previous step:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/netplan/<netcfg>.yaml
```

Modify the file to include the static IP configuration. Below is an example configuration:

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    enp5s0: # Replace with your network interface name
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no
      addresses: [157.80.92.139/24] # Replace with your desired static IP and subnet mask
      routes: 
        - to: default
          via: 157.80.92.11 # Replace with your router's IP address
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4] # Replace with your preferred DNS servers
```

> **Note**: Ensure that the static IP address is within the same subnet as your router and does not conflict with other devices on the network.

---

## 3. Apply the Configuration

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

This will activate the static IP settings.

---

## 4. Verify the Configuration

To confirm that the static IP address has been applied, use the following command:

```bash
ip a
```
