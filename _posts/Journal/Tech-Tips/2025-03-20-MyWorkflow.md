# My Knowledge Management System | Zotero, Obsidian, Readwise, Notion

In today's information-rich world, developing **a personalized knowledge management system** is essential for anyone engaged in academic research, continuous learning, and maintaining balanced productivity. After much experimentation, I've developed **a cross-platform workflow** that effectively bridges my academic research, personal learning journey, and daily life management. Here's how I've structured my digital ecosystem.

## 1. Academic Research Workflow ðŸ’»

My research workflow revolves around two cornerstone software that form the foundation of my academic productivity. I primarily do research on a desktop.

### 1.1. Zotero: My Research Library

Zotero serves as the **central hub** for all my research documents. Here's how I use it:

- **PDF Management**: All academic papers and technical books are stored and categorized here with tags.
- **Annotation & Reading**: I annotate and highlight papers directly within Zotero, capturing key contents during my reading.
- **Research To-Do Lists**: Using Zotero plugin [Notero](https://github.com/dvanoni/notero), my reading queue and priorities sync to Notion, giving me a clear overview for tasks.

### 1.2 Obsidian: My Knowledge Laboratory

Obsidian acts as my **personal knowledge lab** where raw ideas become structured knowledge:

- **Research Notes Hub**: I take detailed notes from Zotero and web resources.
- **Mathematical Notation**: As a control systems and robotics student, I heavily use MathJax for equations.
- **Bidirectional Linking**: Easy to connections between concepts.

### 1.3 Publication Workflow

When research reaches the publication stage, I rely on the following tools:

- **GitHub**: For version control and blog uploads.
- **VSCode + Tex / Overleaf**: For preparing formal LaTeX documents.

## 2. Personal Learning ðŸ’» &ðŸ“±

Beyond academic research, I maintain a continuous learning system:

### 2.1 Content Discovery

- **Readwise Reader**: My primary tool for blog RSS feeds, YouTube videos, Reddit discussions and X content.
- **Inoreader**: For staying current with world events by news RSS feeds.
- **E-reading**: I use Kindle and Apple Books for longer-form content.

### 2.2 Readwise: Knowledge Integration

The magic happens when these inputs are processed:

- **Readwise**: Collects highlights and annotations across all platforms.
- **Integration**: My highlights and notes automatically sync to Notion and NotebookLM.

## 3. Life Management System ðŸ’» &ðŸ“±

A productive mind requires an organized life. Here is how I manage my day-to-day life:

### 3.1 Calendar & Task Management

- **Apple Calendar â‡” Google Calendar â‡” Notion Calendar**: Handles all fixed-time commitments like meetings and courses Synced for cross-platform consistency
- **Notion Tasks board**: Dashboard to track my project, research and learning.

### 3.2 Notion: Journal & Reflection

- **Journal**: Both lab work and personal reflections are saved in Notion
- **Visible on Calendar**: I link Notion database to Calendar for easy review.

## The Philosophy Behind My System

This setup isnâ€™t just about **using the right tools**â€”it's about creating an **external brain** that augments my thinking. By maintaining a clear separation between academic research, personal learning, and life management, I can focus on each domain without distraction, while enabling cross-domain insights when needed.

- **Zotero** serves as the primary library that saves all my academic documents.
- **Obsidian** excels at academic work due to its support for mathematical notation and offline functions.
- **Notion** acts as a cloud-based hub, connecting various information domains through task management, journal, research planning and more on multi platforms.
- **Readwise** functions as a collector, ensuring that tracking valuable information. Readwise Reader is as filter, extracting highlights from various sources.

> ðŸ’¡One notable advantage is that Readwise is the only paid service in this entire system, making the setup both cost-effective and highly functional.

As my needs evolve, this system continues to adapt, but the core philosophy remains the same: **Capture everything that interests me, process information thoughtfully, and create meaningful connections between ideas.**

Iâ€™ve kept this overview concise, but there are countless tips and advanced features for Obsidian, Notion, and Zotero that can improve your workflow. You can find a lot of videos or articles about them. But if you're interested in how Iâ€™m using these tools, feel free to ask!
