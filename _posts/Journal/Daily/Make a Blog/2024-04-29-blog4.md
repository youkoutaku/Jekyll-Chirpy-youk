  alt: Chirpy Jekyll Theme
---

This new blog is built today!

I found a Jekyll theme that meets my needs. I successfully deployed the [Chirpy Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) according to the official documentation. So the old version of the blog is no longer viewable.

I wrote [a Chinese article](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/695291923) to document the process to help others in ZhiHu.
