## Why
Last week, I wanted to submit an ES to a company. It's time to start the job search I thought, although it's likely I'll be moving on to a master's program. But the company asked me to provide a website that shows personal skills, achievements, etc. I just typed my GitHub's URL on it. So this time, I want to have a blog to help others understand me. And I also love sharing some of my learning notes. That's why I got started to make this website.

## How 
At first, after reading some suggestions online, I chose the book ["Head First HTML And CSS"](https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=BZIYQtV6yKsC&hl=ja&source=gbs_slider_cls_metadata_0_mylibrary&redir_esc=y) by Elisabeth Robson and Eric Freeman. It took me about 3~4 hours a day for a week, to read, write code, and take notes at the same time. After that, I found some very nice blogs that have given me inspiration on design. I spent a day, mostly on making the navigation bar, even though it's simple.

Thank them very much. What perfect websites!

## ToDo
I hope to finish these pages by the end of next week.

- Archive
- About me
- CN pages
- JP pages

In April I will start working on my graduation research. So, I can't continue learning JavaScript and other knowledge to help me improve this site anytime soon, but I will try to solve the database to share my learning notes.
