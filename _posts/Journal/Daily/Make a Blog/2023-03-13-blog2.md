I used the Webpage HTML Export to help me complete the Categories easily.

- Categories
    - HTML and CSS
    - ディジタル信号処理

But it's not perfect for me. I am facing a problem in that I have learned HTML and CSS, and created a blog layout. But I need a feature that can generate HTML by Markdown file. First of all, I want to keep the layout of the blog I created, so I think using the existing static site builder may not be suitable for me. So now I'm using some plugins to help me quickly export a large number of Markdown files into HTML, but the problem is that the exported HTML files don't have the same layout of my blog. What should I do? Learning JavaScript or Python about static web page generators and scripts that can help me, that's my next step.
